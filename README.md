### A game I made as a sophomore in college. [needs ALOT of work]

Simple Java Swing game I made for fun while learning Java. 

I didn't care about the visuals very much, so I made the pixel art very quickly.

Trying it now, the controls are very laggy. I remember them being much better, but I could be mistaken.
